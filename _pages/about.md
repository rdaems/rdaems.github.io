I am currently a postdoc at Ghent University - imec, in the group of [Thomas Demeester](https://tdmeeste.github.io/).
My main research interests are stochastic differential equations, fractional Brownian motion, diffusion models, and combinations or variations of all these, in the application domain of **machine learning for drug discovery**.

My [PhD dissertation](/phd) is on the intersection of visual perception, (stochastic) dynamical systems and physics priors.
I started (still ongoing) international collaborations with [Tolga Birdal](https://tolgabirdal.github.io/) and [Manfred Opper](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/opper-manfred) on SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion which led to an [ICLR spotlight paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rtx8B94JMS). Subsequently, I contributed to work led by [Gabriel Nobis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-nobis-60258a284) on [generative fractional diffusion models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/2d2cf241331d7e71a6f20e9ed798a06b-Abstract-Conference.html) and [fractional Schr√∂dinger bridges](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PoEFXbYNii).

During my PhD I co-founded [Hippo Dx](https://www.hippo-dx.com), a medical device start-up.
We developed the automated skin prick test device (SPAT),
enabling consistent and precise allergen testing and freeing precious medical professionals time.
I mainly worked on the camera and custom lighting system, image processing and [AI-assisted diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05862).

Before starting my PhD, I worked in industry for a few years.
After graduating from Ghent University in 2016 with a master's degree in electromechanical engineering I started working at [CNH Industrial](https://www.cnhindustrial.com/), in the [combine harvester](https://youtu.be/Y5I04EObZNo) innovation team.
There I had the chance to learn a lot about computer vision, and apply deep learning to automate combine harvesters.
In 2018 I switched to Octinion, a smaller R&D company, where I worked on many deep learning projects in the agricultural sector.
In my role as AI lead I introduced deep learning in the company and coached colleagues on a technical level.

On this website I write about my research as well as side projects. I live in the beautiful city of [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) with my wonderful [wife](https://berdiekesoete.be) and three kids.
