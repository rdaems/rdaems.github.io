After graduating from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) in 2016 with a master's degree in electromechanical engineering I started working at [CNH Industrial](https://www.cnhindustrial.com/), in the [combine harvester](https://youtu.be/Y5I04EObZNo) innovation team.
There I had the chance to learn a lot about computer vision, and apply deep learning to automate combine harvesters.

In 2018 I switched to Octinion, a smaller R&D company, where I worked on many deep learning projects in the agricultural sector.
In my role as AI lead I introduced deep learning in the company and coached colleagues on a technical level.
I started a PhD in collaboration with Octinion in 2019, partly funded by VLAIO (Baekeland mandate).

In 2020 I co-founded [Hippo Dx](https://hippo-dx.com), a medical device start-up.
We developed the automated skin prick test device (SPAT),
enabling consistent and precise allergen testing and freeing precious medical professionals time.
My main responsibilities are the camera and custom lighting system, image processing and automated diagnosis with deep learning.

Since March 2021 I pivoted my PhD in a more fundamental research direction.
My research is on the intersection of visual perception, (stochastic) dynamical systems and control.
I started an international collaboration with [Tolga Birdal](https://tolgabirdal.github.io/) and [Manfred Opper](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/opper-manfred) on [variational inference for stochastic differential equations driven by fractional noise](https://videoneuralsde.github.io/).

On this website I write about my research as well as side projects. I live in the beautiful city of [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) with my wonderful [wife](https://berdiekesoete.be) and three kids.
