After graduating from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) in 2016 with a master's degree in electromechanical engineering I started working at [CNH Industrial](https://www.cnhindustrial.com/), in the [combine harvester](https://youtu.be/Y5I04EObZNo) innovation team.
There I had the chance to learn a lot about computer vision, and apply deep learning to automate combine harvesters.

In 2018 I switched to Octinion, a smaller R&D company, where I worked on many deep learning projects in the agricultural sector.
In my role as AI lead I introduced deep learning in the company and coached colleagues on a technical level.
I started a PhD in collaboration with Octinion in 2019, partly funded by VLAIO ([Baekeland mandate](https://youtu.be/O5IsAt2m45I)).

Since March 2021 I am no longer working at Octinion and continuing my PhD in a more fundamental research direction.
My research is on the intersection of visual perception, dynamical systems and control.

On this blog I write about my research as well as side projects. I live in the beautiful city of [Bruges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges) with my wonderful [wife](https://berdiekesoete.be) and two kids.
