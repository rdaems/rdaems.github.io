We present KeyCLD, a framework to learn Lagrangian dynamics from images.
Learned keypoints represent semantic landmarks in images and can directly represent state dynamics.
Interpreting this state as Cartesian coordinates coupled with explicit holonomic constraints,
allows expressing the dynamics with a constrained Lagrangian.
Our method explicitly models kinetic and potential energy,
thus allowing energy based control.
We are the first to demonstrate learning of Lagrangian dynamics from images on the dm_control pendulum, cartpole and acrobot environments.
This is a step forward towards learning Lagrangian dynamics from real-world images, since
previous work in literature was only applied to minimalistic images with monochromatic shapes on empty backgrounds.
